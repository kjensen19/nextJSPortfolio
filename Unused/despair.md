***On the hiring process, live technicals, attachment, and (not) getting the offer**

Looking for a job, especially if you are changing careers, has been (in my experience) painful and I've been very fortunate so far. The rumor goes that some Prime grads put in well north of 100 applications before they get their first job. Fortunate becase while I've had my first tastes of rejection, I've also only put in 7 applications and only three were realistic (and two of them are still possible). But that third one, that one stung.

Not because of them, I dug my own grave on this one and they were very aware of the amount of time I was
investing (as were they) across the last month, but after an interview with the director of software development and a take home code challenge they still wanted me to have a 1.5 hour follow-up technical interview with two senior engineers followed by another interview with the director... I thought I had it, because I'm technically very good. And this place sounded like such a good fit for me: a cool-stack with a mix of legacy code and newer tech where I knew some pieces but still had a lot of room to learn (Ruby!?!Typescript?!?graphQL?!?AWS Lambdas!), a pro-learning culture, small teams. I thought all I needed to do was show that the takehome wasn't a fluke, I can do things and I had it. And for the first hour that's more or less how it went, I wasn't amazing (I have a lot to learn), but I felt like it was solid and I just needed to bring it home with some live coding.

The short explanation is that, at that point, the wheels came off. I was inexplicably way more nervous than I expected, and when confronted with a problem that required nesting two for loops to iterate through arrays and make comparisons...I choked. In that 20ish minutes that felt like an eternity I could not break out of the inner loop once I found a match to get the next outer value... I couldn't get it to work because the first time I did it I used **break** as one does, when they want to break out of an inner loop... Unfortunately I put it in the wrong spot and instead of moving it I panicked and inexplicably decided that I needed to use **return** instead... Perhaps you can already see the problem, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out why using a return inside one function...which can only have one return... wasn't giving me the behavior I expected. The engineers were incredibly compassionate, kind, gracious, and as helpful as possible while I was floundering but I don't think I did a good job communicating my thought process, because it was mostly things like:

    - This should work
    - Why isn't this working
    - Oh no
    - This is so simple, why isn't it working
    - I know how to do this, what is wrong with me???
    - etc

What I showed to them made me look inflexible, ineffective, incapable, incommunicative, and probably at least a little bit insane. It was not my best moment. Mercifully that part ended and I wrapped up with the director which felt good. So I was, in spite of my abject failure, hopeful that I would get the chance to show what I'm actually capable of. And then two days later I got the dreaded 'Sadly, XYZ has declined to make an offer'.

Failing is awful, and failing because I blew it even more awful. And putting in a bunch of time and effort to a job I didn't get is awful. And getting attached to a company and then not getting an offer is awful. And having to turn around and start looking again after a month of thinking I found something is awful. Getting attached to things is awful. Searching for jobs is awful. Applying to jobs to just get auto-rejected by a robot is awful. Getting rejected in any context is awful. And it is really hard not to feel like all of that awfulness is a part of me-- that those things are awful because I'm awful, but they aren't and neither am I. I'm incredibly grateful that I have people in my life who remind me of all the things that seem cliche:

    - I'm not awful
    - It is going to be okay
    - I'll get the next one
    - They made a mistake
    - I saw a posting at a cool place you should apply at
    - It happened to me
    
In short people who have reminded me that even though it feels awful right now, it isn't going to feel that way forever. I am truly, deeply indebted to my family, friends and the amazing group of developers in L'Engle... Which is why I brought failure donuts to class yesterday, because failure doesn't need to be hidden especially if its visiblity makes it easier for people to remember that they are not their failures.
