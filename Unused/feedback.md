**Feedback Loop**
Created a **simple**, **reusable** survey form to satisfy the need to collect feedback without overburdening the user with complexity. 
- **I** also focused on learning Material UI through this project, starting with the idea of a responsive mobile and desktop friendly format. I really enjoy the stark simplicity that I was able to achieve here as well as the modular nature of the components that make switching out questions very simple and quick.
- **MUI** technologies utilized include: 
    - Theme toggle 
    - Snackbar 
    - Cards 
    - Accordion 
    - Alerts 
    - Menu 
    - Paper
    - Box 
    - Container 
    - Stack
