**Summary** Basic ToDo app, more focused on the tools than the content of the app
- **Backend** Python Django with the REST framework, focused on refreshing some Python and exploring what turns out to be a very powerful framework. API construction was straightforward, the ORM is an awesome addition (even if my SQL is good enough that I don't need it), used PostgreSQL for a DB.
- **Frontend** Still very much a work in progress, but utilizing Angular with Typescript has been a fun learning experience although it hasn't converted me from a React/Next acolyte.
- **Someday** Much more to be done in terms of styling as well as exploring the built in templating for Django admins
- **Deployment** TBD
