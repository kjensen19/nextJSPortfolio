**Summary** Basic multiplication application to help my 3rd grader practice his multiplication tables. Unfortunately he learned them fast than my development process. Still planning on cleaning it up so he can use it to learn bigger numbers, etc
- **Stack** This one was pretty basic, I just wanted to practice building something from the ground up. So I did.
- **Someday** I would love to turn this into more of a game at some point, we'll see when I have the time.
- **Deployment** Maybe someday, after I get to the gamefication
