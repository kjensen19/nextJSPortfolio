**Saga Movie Gallery**
This project was centered around the use of **Redux** and **Sagas** to centralize communication with the server as well utilizing multi-table **SQL** joins to gather information and manipulate the data being stored. Overall it went signifcantly smoother than the earlier gallery project, but that also meant that it was hard to diffrentiate from the earlier gallery project, aside from the distinct lack of suffering this time around!
The base functionality includes: 
- Displaying a responsive gallery
- The ability to zoom into a detail page 
- Adding a movie with multiple genres 
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Basic navigation in a top bar.
