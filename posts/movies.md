**Saga Movie Gallery**
This project was centered around the use of **Redux** and **Sagas** to centralize communication with the server as well utilizing multi-table **SQL** joins to gather information and manipulate the data being stored
The base functionality includes: 
- Displaying a responsive gallery
- The ability to zoom into a detail page 
- Adding a movie with multiple genres 
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Basic navigation in a top bar.
