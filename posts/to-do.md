**A** combination **todo** and **calendar** app that displays todo items on their targeted completion days. 
- **Items** can be clicked to show a more detailed view on a side panel 
- **Tasks** can be marked as completed which is denoted by both text and green coloration. 
- **Tasks** can also be deleted which removes them from the calendar and the task database. 
- **Designed** to address the need for both apps (because clearly there aren't any other options). I also used it as an opportunity to explore **bootstrap** **modals** and **offcanvases**.
