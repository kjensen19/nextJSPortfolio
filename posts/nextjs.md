**Portfolio (NextJS)** Working on building a personal portfolio site while also learning a new framework. This was a lot of fun, but I know that the tutorial really only scratched the surface of what Next is capable of and I'm looking forward to really exploring those depths in the (hopefully) near future.
- **Routing** I'm not the world's biggest React Router fan, so the ability to dynamically route in relation to files in the project felt incredible so slick and easy to work with.
- **Images** I know the formatting etc here is intended to be one of the strong points of the framework, but because of my varying sizes of images I wasn't as impressed, but that's mostly a me issue.
- **CSS** The ability to more clearly target elements with CSS is great, I'm looking forward to learning to incorporate Tailwind (and maybe trying MUI here at some point, although that may introduce some extra complications)
- **Rendering options/hydration on demand** Hasn't played a big role in this project, but the SSR in particular is a huge selling point with Next. Excited to further explore the capabilities around API calls.
- **Deployment** Vercel made this really easy to deploy from github and monitors the repo for updates
